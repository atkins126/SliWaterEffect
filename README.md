# SliWater
Water effect on a bitmap. Written in Turbo Delphi.

This is based on CnPack Component Package (CnVcl) source code, itself based on Hugo Elias' algorithm.
However, it doesn't require CnVcl, so you can implement it in your projects without having CnVCL (and/or CnWizards) installed.
Original algorithm by Hugo Elias is archived here:
